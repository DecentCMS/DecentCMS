The default mechanism to store content items in Decent CMS is to use
files under the /sites directory.
This can be replaced with database storage, but the file storage has
some unique advantages.
While it's obviously not something you'd use on a big site, being
able to xcopy contents, and deploy contents with a simple ftp client
is very powerful.
Being able to look into subdirectories and find content items as
single files that can be modified with a simple text editor is
extremely comfortable.
