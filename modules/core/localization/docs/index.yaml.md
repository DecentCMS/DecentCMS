title: Localization

-8<------------------------------------------------------------------

The localization module provides localization support for code.
A simple helper enables code to specify string constants in the
default language (typically English), and still enable the system to
localize them if the current culture is different.

For the moment, this feature is a stub. It should be used everywhere
but won't do anything at the moment.
