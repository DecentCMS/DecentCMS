title: Widgets

-8<------------------------------------------------------------------

Widgets are reusable pieces of contents.
They are managed in layers, which are groups of widgets that can be
turned on or off according to custom rules.
For example, you can create a layer that only gets displayed on the
commerce pages of your site, and that contains a shopping cart
widget.

The module provides a basic implementation where layers and widgets
are stored in the file system.
