title: Multi-Tenancy

-8<------------------------------------------------------------------

The multi-tenancy module enables the hosting of multiple web sites on
a single DecentCMS instance.
It does so by creating dependency injection scopes for each sites,
enabling each site to work independently, with their own settings,
themes, and features, as if they were distinct instances entirely.
Eventually, it will also enable some content syndication between
tenants.
