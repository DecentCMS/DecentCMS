title: Express

-8<------------------------------------------------------------------

The Express module integrates the Express framework into DecentCMS,
enabling the core platform to expose itself as middleware.

This module can also be used to add custom middleware to DecentCMS,
in a way that is compatible with multi-tenancy, feature enabling,
and dependency injection.
